      <p>
        Turmoil has engulfed the
        Galactic Republic. The taxation
        of trade routes to outlying star
        systems is in dispute.

        with a blockade of deadly
        battleships, the greedy Trade

        That's fine as long as you're always looking for a way to adapt it to your own needs.
        However, you need to walk away from this tutorial knowing that
        columns represent only one type of layout.
        You can use CSS in this way to create multiple layouts for use on different pages that
        need to present a different user experience.</p>
